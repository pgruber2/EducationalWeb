The following instructions have been tested with Python2.7 on Linux and MacOS

1. Install and run ElsticSearch

```bash
make up
```

2. Create the index in ElasticSearch by running 

```bash
python create_es_index.py
```

3. Download tfidf_outputs.zip from here -- https://drive.google.com/file/d/19ia7CqaHnW3KKxASbnfs2clqRIgdTFiw/view?usp=sharing
   
   Unzip the file and place the folder under `EducationalWeb/static`
